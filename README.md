## READ THIS FIRST

Hello there, you seem to have quite an exploratory personality.  
Anyway if you found this place, you probably can figure out how to get to the solutions.  
Please don't publicize this branch, if people really want to know how to solve something then they'll find this themselves or ask someone else.


If you do contribute a challenge, please also have a similar branch on your fork with a similar setup (some obscurity), although it isn't required.
